/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 0. An operator performs some action(operation) on a single, or on multiple data values(operands).  Operations produce a result. 
 * There are several groups of operators: arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, unary, & ternary.
 * 1. Assignment operators assign values to their left operand, based on the value of the right operand. These operators make code more
 * coherent.
 * 2. Arithmetic operators are used to perform math operations on numerical operands.
 * 3. Comparison operators compare the left and right operands to return a Boolean value.
 * 4. Logical operators
 * 5. Unary operators
 * 6. Ternary operators
 *
