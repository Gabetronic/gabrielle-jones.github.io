/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0. Variables are variously described as containers or bindings, because they store or hold a data value(or values) for later use.
 * Depending on the values a variable holds, variables can be constant for the program's duration, they can change at the whim of the 
 * programmer's decision, or they can simply point to other variables.
 * 
 * 1. A programmer must declare a variable, or name it, using a certain set of rules in order for the value(s) they intend to bind.
 * Once a variable declaration is performed, a programmer should assign the variable to the value(s) they intend to bind.  If a 
 * programmer performs both of the declaration and assignment simultaneously, it is said that they have initialized a variable. 
 * 
 * 2. Var, let and const are keywords required to create variables.  They each have varying traits, but must be written before the actual 
 * variable name itself.  The var keyword creates variables that are either global- or function-scoped, meaning the programming environment 
 * can access var variables anywhere in the program
