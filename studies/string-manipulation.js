/**
 * STRING MANIPULATION:
 * 
 * 0. Strings store and change text -- they are an important part of computer programming. As such,
 * there are various tolls available to manipulate the value of a string.
 * 
 * 1. There are a few operators that can help you re-assign or compare strings: the assignment,
 * concatenation, strictly equals, loosely equals, and a combination of the assignment and
 * concatenation operators.  
 * 
 * 2.  There are several functions, or methods used on strings; some take in arguments and 
 * others don't.
