/**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 0. In computing terms, a function is a small program that receives input, acts on that data, and outputs the result of its 
 * action(s).  Functions are both fundamental to JavaScript, and very popular because of their reusability and ability to 
 * simplify code.
 * 1. The actions inherent to functions are divided into two phases: declaration and invocation.  The declaration phase uses 
 * specific syntax to form the outline of how the function will behave: what it will take in as input, what task(s) it will 
 * perform on that input data, and what users can expect from its output(s). A function invocation, or call occurs when a
 * user wants to implement the function on specific data; it also uses a set syntax to pass data, or argument(s) into the
 * function body.
 * 2. Depending on the programmer's intent, functions can: be named, or unnamed, aka anonymous; parameters & arguments can be
 * optional; and functions can be attached to variables (these are called function expressions), or they can stand alone as
 * function declarations.
 * 3. The code inside a function body can access, modify and hold on to particular variables based on where they are located in 
 * the coding environment and whether they are declared with var, let or const.

 * 2 phases: declaration & invocation/calling
 * Difference btw params(are assigned) & args(are passed) / are they optional? / how are they described/written?

 * Func Exp. def
 * Diff btw func-scoped variables, global-scoped vars: why can func-scoped modify/use parent or global, but not vice versa?
 * Def. of closure in relation to funcs
